Introduction to Bitmine General Hash-Mining Platform

Bitmine General Hash-Mining Platform("Bitmine" for abbreviation) is officially
launched in 2021 to bring easy Ether mining experience to cryptocurrency community.
Bitmine’s mission is to take hash-mining of mainstream cryptocurrencies to the next
level.

On Bitmine, users could subscribe Ethereum hashing power token EHC and receiving
ETH mining reward by staking EHC. Subscription smart contract deployed on Binance
Smart Chain will mint EHC and distribute EHC to subscribers. EHC smart contract
deployed on Binance Smart Chain will automatically distribute Ethereum PoW mining
reward to EHC stakers.

Bitmine could be perceived as a mutual fund that periodically opens for subscription.
EHC holders who’ve staked will have EHT mining reward allocated to them by smart
contract.

At initial launch, there are two tokens offered on Bitmine: **BIM** and **EHC**.

**BIM**

BIM is the platform governance token of Bitmine. BIM has a total supply cap of
1,000,000 and zero initial supply. It is 100% obtained by users through engagement with
Bitmine.

**EHC**

Ethereum Mining is a resilent and robust way of obtaining ETH. EHC is a token that
represents the Ethereum PoW hashing power on Bitmine platform. 1 EHC strictly pegs to
0.01Mhash/s hashing power of Ethereum PoW network. EHC has provided the market
with a new vehicle to participate in Ethereum mining. ETH mining reward is allocated to
EHC holders by smart contract deployed on Binance Smart Chain.
